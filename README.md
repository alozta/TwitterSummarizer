Twitter Summarizer v 0.9
------------------------------

------------------------------
TwitterSummarizer is a basic summarize tool for twitter. This version gets up to determined size of tweets and outputs them as (word, frequency) format.
------------------------------

------------------------------
Before you use it you need to:
+twitter4j API which can be found on http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html#download
+auth keys to get tweets which must be gotten from twitter itself.

I hesitate about which way I supposed to lead and for that I'm open for new suggestions.

I'm currently thinking to add a user interface for easy interaction.
